            <h2>Myself</h2>
            <p>
              <span>27</span> year old native to Arizona, I grew up always
              looking for change. Whether that was in sports throughout school
              or work throughout my career, I always look for new challenges.
              Changes can come from simply changing my daily routine or looking
              for new doors / opportunities within my job.

              <span>While</span> I do enjoy meeting and talking to new people
              with similar interests, I am the definition of a homebody. During
              my free time, I truly enjoy spending time with my amazing
              girlfriend Jessica, our dorky doberman Anubis and our rageful
              loving cat Blair.

            <h2>Coding</h2>
            <p>
              <span>Starting</span> towards the end of 2018, I enrolled in a 12
              week coding bootcamp at the University of Arizona. I finished and
              got my completition certificate in 2019. I spent 2019 coding
              during my free time while learning and adjusting to a recent
              promotion. In 2020 I continued coding during my free time amid
              working two jobs majority of the year. Come 2021, the company I
              worked for was bought out and I spent the year working with new
              coworkers and managers remotely in teaching them how to use our
              companies technology and systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Ending</span> 2021, I've come to realize my love and
              enjoyment for coding. To have a UI design in front of me and
              planning out how to turn the design to code is a fun and exciting
              challenge for me. I get this same feeling whenever I draw and or
              plate a new meal I've cooked. With more free time, I've made the
              decision to work my way into the tech field as a
              <span>Frontend Web Developer.</span>
